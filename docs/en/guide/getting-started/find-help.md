# Getting Help

Luna Park is growing rapidly, and we need your help to make it even better. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, don't hesitate to contact us. We're here to help!

## The Forum

The forum is the ideal place to ask questions and find answers. You can ask questions about Luna Park, share your experiences and ideas, and discuss with other users.

It is accessible at the following address: [forum.luna-park.app](https://forum.luna-park.app).

Account creation is done through your Luna Park account. If you don't have an account, you can create one directly on the [homepage](https://luna-park.app/).

## Discord

Discord is another way to get help and chat with other users. It allows you to ask questions in real-time and share your experiences with other users. However, you may receive less detailed answers than on the forum.

It is accessible at the following address: [discord.gg/2eAk2AHvdw](https://discord.gg/2eAk2AHvdw).
