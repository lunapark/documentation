# How is Luna Park different from other app creators?

## Traditional no-code solutions

No-code solutions are generally **hosting companies**, meaning they host your project and you pay based on the usage of their servers.

Their motivation is to keep you on their platform, which means you are tied to their servers and their limitations. They are incentivized not to generate overly performant applications so they can sell you more powerful servers.

## Our solution, Luna Park

Luna Park, on the other hand, is a **development environment** (IDE). You pay a fixed amount, regardless of your project. The generated code belongs to you, so you can host it wherever you want without any constraints.

Our motivation is to enable you to create high-performance and scalable applications quickly and efficiently. We are incentivized to provide you with the best tool for creating your applications.

## The trade-off

Luna Park is a lower-level tool than other no-code solutions. This means it is a bit more complex to learn, but allows you to **do much more** and offers **native performance**.
