# What is Luna Park?

Luna Park is a **visual programming framework**. It allows you to create **fast** and **scalable** web applications without having to write code.

Many advanced features are available, such as reactivity, visual programming, CRON management, backend creation, and much more. It is aimed at both **developers** and **non-developers**.

### For Developers

In Luna Park, you will find all the features you expect from a **modern JS framework** (like React, Vue, or Angular), but without having to write code. You can create reusable components, manage the state of your application, and even create backend APIs.

### For Non-Developers

Luna Park is designed to provide the same level of flexibility as code, but with an **intuitive visual interface**. You will be able to develop applications as complex as those you could create with code, but without having to worry about syntax or compilation errors.

## How does visual scripting differ from other no-code logic?

Luna Park's **visual scripting** engine allows you to build any type of logic possible with code, with native performance. There are no limits to what you can create, and the result is **extremely lightweight** and **high-performing**.

From a technical standpoint, the logic you create with visual scripting is compiled directly into JavaScript, with each node equivalent to a line of code. In production, it is not read by a heavy interpreter like other tools, but directly executed by the JavaScript engine.

### Note on Visual Scripting

Visual scripting is actually a branch of no-code. Here, when we talk about "traditional no-code," we are referring to tools that allow you to create logic in a simplified way.

Visual scripting is a more advanced approach that allows you to create complex logic, requiring knowledge of algorithms and architecture.
