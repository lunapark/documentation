# What is Luna Park?

Luna Park is a **visual programming framework**. It allows you to create **fast** and **scalable** web applications without having to write code.

Many advanced features are available, such as reactivity, visual programming, CRON management, backend creation, and much more. It is aimed at both **developers** and **non-developers**.



## How does visual scripting differ from other no-code logic?

Luna Park's **visual scripting** engine allows you to build any type of logic possible with code, with native performance. There are no limits to what you can create, and the result is **extremely lightweight** and **high-performing**.

From a technical standpoint, the logic you create with visual scripting is compiled directly into JavaScript, with each node equivalent to a line of code. In production, it is not read by a heavy interpreter like other tools, but directly executed by the JavaScript engine.

### Note on Visual Scripting

Visual scripting is actually a branch of no-code. Here, when we talk about "traditional no-code," we are referring to tools that allow you to create logic in a simplified way.

Visual scripting is a more advanced approach that allows you to create complex logic, requiring knowledge of algorithms and architecture.
