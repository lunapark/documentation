# Is Luna Park right for me?

## For No-Coders

Luna Park is at about the same level of complexity as **Bubble**: you will need to understand concepts of **logic, flow, and data**.
The tool offers more **control** and **flexibility** than a classic builder: it's not just an assembly of blocks.

## For Developers

Getting started is **fast**. The visual logic remains very close to the code structure you know: you will find all the features you expect from a **modern JS framework** but without having to write code. You can create reusable components, manage your application's state, and even create backend APIs.

## For Beginners

Luna Park is perfect for **learning web development**. You will discover the fundamental concepts of a real web application (state, logic, data...) but with a **visual interface** that makes learning much less intimidating than raw code.

## Recommended Use Cases

Luna Park is ideal for **creating complex and sustainable applications** as well as **reusable prototypes**, allowing you to design a **functional MVP** and **extend it without starting from zero**.
