# Editor

The editor allows you to build your application using layouts and visual logic. It consists of several panels that serve different purposes.

## The Explorer

The explorer is located at the top left of the editor. It allows you to create a new file with a `right-click`, select it with a `double-click`, and delete it with the `delete` key. You can create folders to better organize your project, but the structure does not affect the logic of your application.

## Options Panel

The options panel is located at the bottom left of the editor. It displays various information related to the file currently in use. Here, a layout component is open, and the options panel displays its layout tree. To set a file as the working file, you must `double-click` it in the explorer panel.

## The Inspector

The inspector is located on the right side of the editor. It displays various information related to the selected element (a file, a layout element, a logic node, etc.). Here, a layout element is selected, and the inspector displays its properties.

## The Console

The console is located at the bottom of the editor. It allows you to log values to debug your application. To display a value in it, you must use the `log` node in the logic editor. Note that the value will also be sent to your browser's console.

## The Main View

Finally, the main view is the central part of the editor. It displays a visualization of the working file. In this case, the builder mode of a layout component is selected, so it displays the visual builder of the layout.
