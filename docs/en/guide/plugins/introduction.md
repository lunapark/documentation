# Introduction to Plugins

Luna Park supports plugins to extend its functionality. Plugins can introduce a wide range of features, including new components, logic nodes, design tokens, and more.

## Installing Plugins

A list of available plugins can be found in the `Libraries > Plugins > Install Plugins` panel.

## Creating Plugins

You can also create your own plugins to add custom features to Luna Park. If you are familiar with TypeScript (and Vue for components), you can get started immediately.
