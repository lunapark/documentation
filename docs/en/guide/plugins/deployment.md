## Restricted distribution

If you intend to restrict the distribution of your plugin, you can push it to github and use a service like https://pkg.pr.new/ to distribute it. People will have to paste the url of your plugin in the "Install from URL" input.

## Public distribution

If you want your plugin to appear on the search page in Luna Park, you need to publish it on npm with the tags `luna-park` and `plugin`. It will be available for everyone to install.
