:::warning
Luna Park's compilation system does not yet support plugins. While you can use plugins during the development phase, full compilation support will be available soon.

## Restricted Distribution

If you wish to distribute your plugin privately, you can host it on GitHub and use a service like [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new/). Users will need to manually enter your plugin's URL in the "Install from URL" field.

## Public Distribution

To make your plugin discoverable in Luna Park's search page, publish it to npm with the tags `luna-park` and `plugin`. This will make it available for public installation.
