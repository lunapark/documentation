# Introduction

Visual scripting (visual programming) is a way to develop logic without code. Instead of writing traditional language code, you connect graphical blocks representing actions, conditions, or data.

## What are the benefits?

- **Performance**: The created logic is compiled into JS code, offering performance equivalent to a manually coded application.
- **Freedom**: Most functions available in code are accessible in visual scripting, allowing you to create complex logic.
- **Accessibility**: Removing the syntactic aspect of code reduces learning time and makes it easier to create logic.

## What you will learn in this section

In this section, you will discover how to use the visual programming editor to:
- Build and connect logical blocks (nodes).
- Manage dynamic variables and data flows.
- Implement conditions, loops, and API calls.
